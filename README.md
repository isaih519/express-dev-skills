# express-dev-skills

INTRO
The focus of this deliverable is to list skills on a local host.

Express is a popular unopinionated web framework, written in JavaScript and hosted within the Node.js runtime environment.

With Express we have three capabilities:

The ability to define routes
The ability to process HTTP requests using middleware
The ability to use a view engine to render dynamic templates
Using the terminal to run Nodeman, I can take a look into my localhost:3000 server and view the app listing my dev skills. Also, the ability to add new skills or even remove skills using Express.
